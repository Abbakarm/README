# 3MTT Project: Exploratory Data Analysis of [Project Name]
By Abubakar | 3MTT Data Science Fellow

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **3MTT DeepTech** training. I analyzed a dataset of [describe the data, e.g., Nigerian Agricultural yields] to find trends and insights that could help [mention a goal, e.g., improve rural farming decisions].

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas (Data Cleaning), Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- **Database:** SQL (Data Extraction)

## 📖 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values and standardized column names.
2. **Exploratory Analysis:** Calculated averages, medians, and identified outliers.
3. **Visualization:** Created bar charts to show [Key Insight A] and scatter plots for [Key Insight B].

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Finding 1:** [Example: Rural areas have 40% less access to tech jobs than urban centers.]
- **Finding 2:** [Example: Power availability directly correlates with project completion rates.]

## 🚀 Challenges Overcome
- **The "Village" Constraint:** Developed this code in a low-power environment by optimizing Python scripts to run locally without needing heavy cloud resources.
- **Data Quality:** Cleaned a "messy" dataset with 20% missing values using Python's `.fillna()` method.
